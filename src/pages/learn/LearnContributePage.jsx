          <p>
            Everything you use as a technologist, designer, or creator today was
            built on a foundation of openly shared work. Linux powers most of the
            internet. Git — the tool you use to manage every project — was built by
            Linus Torvalds and given away. React, Node, VS Code, Python, PostgreSQL,
            the entire modern web stack — open source, all of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Richard Stallman argued decades ago that software should be free — not
            free as in "no cost," but free as in freedom. The freedom to study it, modify
            it, share it. That philosophy became the Free and Open Source Software
            movement. It changed everything. Not because corporations decided to be
            generous, but because individuals contributed what they could — a patch here,
            a bug report there, documentation, testing, funding.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Open Vector exists in that tradition. This is not a product. It is a
            shared resource, built openly, improved collectively. The curriculum, the
            guides, the tools — they belong to the community that uses them. Like the
            projects that inspired it, the Open Vector runs on contributions from the
            people it serves.

            The Open Vector is a non-profit project. There is no company behind this,
            no venture funding, no ad revenue. It is one person building a free learning
            platform because it should exist.
          </p>
          <p>
            The real costs — Supabase, Netlify, domain registration, the Claude API
            that powers the chat — come out of my pocket. In the grand scheme of things,
            it is not a life-altering expense. But these projects can quietly run a few
            hundred dollars a month, and I just... pay it. Along with the time, the
            stewardship, and the effort to build and maintain all of this.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am not going to pretend anyone is "buying me a coffee." But if you have
            ever gotten something useful out of the Open Vector — a concept that clicked,
            a guide that saved you hours, a conversation with the AI tutor that pointed
            you in the right direction — you could throw in the cost of a Taco Bell run.
            Or a fountain Diet Pepsi at a gas station. That is genuinely what we are
            talking about here. A few dollars offsets the hosting. A few more covers the
            AI. It adds up.
