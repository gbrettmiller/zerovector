The more you ask it to hold in its head — frontend code, backend logic, deployment config, marketing copy, database schemas — the more diluted its attention becomes. It starts making mistakes. It forgets conventions. It conflates different parts of the system.',
          'Multiple agents solve this by specialization. Your frontend agent only thinks about components and styling. Your backend agent only thinks about APIs and data. Your content agent only thinks about copy and messaging. Each one is deeply focused on its domain, and you coordinate the handoffs.',
