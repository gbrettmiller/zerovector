Visitor clicks "Contact" in the navigation bar\n2. Page scrolls to (or navigates to) the contact section\n3. Visitor sees a form with fields: Name, Email, Message\n4.

If validation fails: show inline error messages next to the invalid fields\n8. If validation passes: send the message, show a success confirmation\n9. Visitor sees "Message sent! I\'ll get back to you within 48 hours."\n\n### Outcome\nSite owner receives the message in their inbox. Visitor knows the message was sent.\n\n### Edge Cases\n- Empty fields: show validation errors, do not submit\n- Invalid email: show "Please enter a valid email address"\n- Network failure: show "Something went wrong.
