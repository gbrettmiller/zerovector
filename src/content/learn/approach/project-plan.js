          'For AI-assisted projects, vertical slicing is almost always better. Here is why: when you tell Claude Code to build a complete contact form — the component, the validation, the submission endpoint, the success message — it can see the whole picture. It makes better decisions about structure because it understands the full flow.',
          'Horizontal slicing creates a problem: you build a bunch of data models, then weeks later try to build UI on top of them, and discover the models do not match what the UI needs. Vertical slicing catches these mismatches immediately because you are building and testing the full stack at once.',
